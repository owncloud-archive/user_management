Feature: manage user quota
As an admin
I want to manage user quota
So that users can only take up a certain amount of storage space

	Background:
		Given a regular user exists but is not initialized
		And I am logged in as admin
		And I am on the users page

	Scenario Outline: change quota to a valid value
		And quota of user "%regularuser%" is set to "<start_quota>"
		When quota of user "%regularuser%" is changed to "<wished_quota>"
		And the users page is reloaded
		Then quota of user "%regularuser%" should be set to "<expected_quota>"

		Examples:
		|start_quota|wished_quota|expected_quota|
		|Unlimited  |5 GB        |5 GB          |
		|1 GB       |5 GB        |5 GB          |
		|5 GB       |Unlimited   |Unlimited     |
		|1 GB       |Unlimited   |Unlimited     |
		|Unlimited  |5.5 GB      |5.5 GB        |
