Feature: add users
  As an admin
  I want to add users
  So that unauthorised access is impossible

  Background:
    Given user admin has logged in using the webUI
    And the administrator has browsed to the users page

  Scenario: use the webUI to create a simple user
    When the administrator creates a user with the name "guiusr1" and the password "%regular%" using the webUI
    And the administrator logs out of the webUI
    And the user logs in with username "guiusr1" and password "%regular%" using the webUI
    Then the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "Files - %productname%"

  Scenario: use the webUI to create a user with special valid characters
    When the administrator creates a user with the name "@-_.'" and the password "%regular%" using the webUI
    And the administrator logs out of the webUI
    And the user logs in with username "@-_.'" and password "%regular%" using the webUI
    Then the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "Files - %productname%"

  Scenario Outline: use the webUI to create a user with special invalid characters
    When the administrator attempts to create a user with the name <user> and the password <password> using the webUI
    Then notifications should be displayed on the webUI with the text
      | Error creating user: Only the following characters are allowed in a username: "a-z", "A-Z", "0-9", and "_.@-'" |
    And the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "Users - %productname%"
    Examples:
      | user   | password    |
      | "a#%"  | "%regular%" |
      | "a+^"  | "%alt1%"    |
      | "a)~"  | "%alt2%"    |
      | "a(="  | "%alt3%"    |
      | "a`*^" | "%alt4%"    |

  Scenario: use the webUI to create a user with empty password
    When the administrator attempts to create a user with the name "bijay" and the password "" using the webUI
    Then notifications should be displayed on the webUI with the text
      | Error creating user: A valid password must be provided |
    And the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "Users - %productname%"

  Scenario Outline: use the webUI to create a user with less than 3 characters
    When the administrator attempts to create a user with the name <user> and the password <password> using the webUI
    Then notifications should be displayed on the webUI with the text
      | Error creating user: The username must be at least 3 characters long |
    Examples:
      | user | password    |
      | "a"  | "%regular%" |
      | "a1" | "%alt1%"    |

  Scenario: use the webUI to create a simple user with an Email address but without a password
    When the administrator creates a user with the name "guiusr1" and the email "guiusr1@owncloud" without a password using the webUI
    Then the email address "guiusr1@owncloud" should have received an email with the body containing
      """
      just letting you know that you now have an %productname% account.
      
      Your username: guiusr1
      Access it:
      """

  Scenario Outline: user sets his own password after being created with an Email address only
    When the administrator creates a user with the name "<username>" and the email "guiusr1@owncloud" without a password using the webUI
    And the administrator logs out of the webUI
    And the user follows the password set link received by "guiusr1@owncloud" using the webUI
    And the user sets the password to "%regular%" using the webUI
    Then the email address "guiusr1@owncloud" should have received an email with the body containing
      """
      Password changed successfully
      """
    When the user logs in with username "<username>" and password "%regular%" using the webUI
    Then the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "Files - %productname%"
    Examples:
      | username | comment               |
      | guiusr1  | simple user-name      |
      | a@-_.'b  | complicated user-name |

    Then notifications should be displayed on the webUI with the text
      | Error creating user: Invalid mail address |
    Examples:
      | email  | comment        |
      | string | no @ sign      |
      | a@     | no domain name |
      #there would be much more to test here, but its complicated and would be slow
      #see http://codefool.tumblr.com/post/15288874550/list-of-valid-and-invalid-email-addresses
      #email address validation would better go into an unit test
