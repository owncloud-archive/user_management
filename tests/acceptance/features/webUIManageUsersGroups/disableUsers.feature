Feature: disable users
	As an admin
	I want to disable users
	So that I can remove access to unnecessary users
	
	Background:
		Given these users have been created but not initialized:
			|username|password|displayname|email       |
			|user1   |1234    |User One   |u1@oc.com.np|
			|user2   |1234    |User Two   |u2@oc.com.np|
		And user admin has logged in using the webUI
		And the administrator has browsed to the users page
		
	Scenario: disable a user
		When the admin disables the user "user1" using the webUI
		And the disabled user "user1" tries to login using the password "1234" from the webUI
		Then the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "ownCloud"
		When the user has browsed to the login page
		And the user logs in with username "user2" and password "1234" using the webUI
		Then the user should be redirected to a webUI page with the title "Files - ownCloud"
