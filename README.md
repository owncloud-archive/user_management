# User Management

Provides the User and Group Management page on the web UI.

The code has been removed from the core master branch.
The core code removal has not been backported to the core stable10 branch.
So this new app is not yet part of any formal release.

Install and enable this app if you are testing core master functionality and want to manage or test users and groups via the web UI.

When making fixes in this repository, also ensure that the equivalent fix is made in core stable10 so it gets in the 10.0.* release process.

When adding features in this repository, consider if the feature should be backported into core stable10.
